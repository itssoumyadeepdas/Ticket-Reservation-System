# Ticket-Reservation-System

The project objective is to book train tickets in online. The train reservation system is 
an Internet based application that can be accessed throughout the net and can be 
accessed by anyone who has a net connection. This application will reserve the tickets. 
This online ticket reservation system provides a website for the Indian Railway where 
any user of internet can access it. User is required to login to the system and needs 
a credit card/UPI for booking the tickets. The website provides complete information 
regarding currently running trains between capital stations in India and gives the 
information of the available seats and accommodation type. Ticket reservations are 
done using credit card and can be cancelled if needed. Our online tickets reservation 
system is one of the best opportunities for those who cannot afford enough time to get 
their tickets reserved standing in long queues. People can book tickets online at any 
time of day or night. Our reservation system also provides option to cancel the tickets 
which are reserved previously and our portal even gives discount offers for the 
customers to avail.
